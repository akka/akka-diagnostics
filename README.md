Akka
====
*Akka is a powerful platform that simplifies building and operating highly responsive, resilient, and scalable services.*


The platform consists of
* the [**Akka SDK**](https://doc.akka.io/java/index.html) for straightforward, rapid development with AI assist and automatic clustering. Services built with the Akka SDK are automatically clustered and can be deployed on any infrastructure.
* and [**Akka Automated Operations**](https://doc.akka.io/operations/akka-platform.html), a managed solution that handles everything for Akka SDK services from auto-elasticity to multi-region high availability running safely within your VPC.

The **Akka SDK** and **Akka Automated Operations** are built upon the foundational [**Akka libraries**](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-dependencies/current/), providing the building blocks for distributed systems.


Akka Diagnostics
================

Akka Diagnostics is a suite of useful components that complement Akka libraries.

## Akka Thread Starvation Detector

The Akka Thread Starvation Detector is a diagnostic tool that monitors the dispatcher of an ActorSystem and will log a warning if the dispatcher becomes unresponsive.

## Akka Config Checker

The Akka Config Checker tries to help you by finding potential configuration issues. It is based on knowledge that the Akka Team has gathered from typical misunderstanding seen in mailing lists and customer consulting.
